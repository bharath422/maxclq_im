The maximum clique problem is a well known NP-Hard problem with
applications in data mining, network analysis, information retrieval and many other
areas related to the World Wide Web.
There exist several algorithms for the problem with acceptable runtimes for
certain classes of graphs, but many of them are infeasible for massive graphs. 
We present a new exact algorithm that employs novel pruning techniques and 
is able to quickly find maximum cliques in large sparse graphs. 
Extensive experiments on different kinds of synthetic and 
real-world graphs show that our new algorithm can be orders of magnitude 
faster than existing algorithms.
We also present a heuristic that runs orders of magnitude faster than 
the exact algorithm while providing optimal or near-optimal solutions.
