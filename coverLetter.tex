\opening{Dear Professor Bonato:}

At the manuscript submission site, please find an electronic copy of our manuscript titled
``Fast Algorithms for the Maximum Clique Problem on Massive Graphs with Applications to Overlapping Community Detection" to be considered for publication as a Research Paper in the 
{\em Special Issue of the Journal of Internet Mathematics}.

In this manuscript, we extended the work we presented at the ``{\em $10^{th}$ Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the World Wide Web}" titled  ``{\em Fast Algorithms for the Maximum Clique Problem on Massive Sparse Graphs}". We have supplemented this with a comprehensive analysis of our algorithms and experimental results. We have also added two new sections. The first is about the parallelization of our algorithms and experimental evaluation on shared memory platforms. The second is an application of our
algorithms for the purpose of detecting overlapping communities in a network. We present a much faster algorithm for clique-based overlapping community detection. We corroborate the validity and performance of our algorithm by comparing it with other similar algorithms on synthetic as well as real-world networks.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

\closing{Best regards,}
\end{letter}
